# Sine-Graph-Visualizer

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the development server and build tool for a modern, fast development experience.\
\
Use this to visualize your sine graph

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) ( v16+)
